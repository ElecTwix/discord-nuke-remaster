# Discord Nuke Remaster
 
 Hello people, long time ago I was working on some discord nuke project it was mess
 it is not working properly and so much people reaching me for not working so I made another for security checking purposes.
 
 ## Usage
 
 **(optional)** if you want build from source do it and run it once it will create json file **automatically**.
 
 1. Get in config.json put bot token to token variable. 
    - ``` "bot-token" : "token-here", ```
    
       - (   If you want you can change prefix or leave it with default. )


 2. Run the Bot
 
 3. Send Nuke Message to any channel.
 
 4. Enjoy.

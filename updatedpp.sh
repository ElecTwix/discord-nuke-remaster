#
# This script is run on a 15 minute cron by a github action.
# It uses the github client with an organisation token to pull the CI artifacts of the
# last successful CI build on master, and then unzip the windows builds.
# Once the windows builds are unzipped, it extracts the include directory from the 64
# bit release build, and the dlls/libs from all 4 builds, placing them in the correct
# locations in this repository. If they have been changed, this triggers a `git commit`
# followed by a `git push`.
# This script assumes `gh` is authenticated with a usable token and `git` has an SSH
# key ready to use for pushing, and that the checked out `main` branch is current.
# It also assumes nobody has renamed the CI jobs or the artifacts they export as these
# names have to be hard coded into the script.
